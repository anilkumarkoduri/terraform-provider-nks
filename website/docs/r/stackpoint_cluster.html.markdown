# stackpoint\_cluster

Creates and manages a cluster in StackPointCloud's system

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "stackpoint_cluster" "terraform-cluster" {
  org_id                  = "${data.stackpoint_keysets.keyset_default.org_id}"
  cluster_name            = "Test AWS Cluster TerraForm"
  provider_code           = "aws"
  provider_keyset         = "${data.stackpoint_keysets.keyset_default.aws_keyset}"
  region                  = "us-east-2"
  k8s_version             = "v1.8.3"
  startup_master_size     = "${data.stackpoint_instance_specs.master-specs.node_size}"
  startup_worker_count    = 2
  startup_worker_size     = "${data.stackpoint_instance_specs.worker-specs.node_size}"
  zone                    = "us-east-2a"
  provider_network_id_requested     = "__new__"
  provider_network_cidr   = "10.0.0.0/16"
  provider_subnet_id_requested      = "__new__"
  provider_subnet_cidr    = "10.0.0.0/24"
  provider_resource_group = "__new__"
  project_id              = "someproject"
  rbac_enabled            = true
  dashboard_enabled       = true
  etcd_type               = "classic"
  platform                = "coreos"
  channel                 = "stable"
  ssh_keyset              = "${data.stackpoint_keysets.keyset_default.user_ssh_keyset}"
}
