# stackpoint\_cluster

Creates and manages a cluster in StackPointCloud's system

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "stackpoint_cluster" "terraform-cluster" {
  org_id                            = "${data.stackpoint_keysets.keyset_default.org_id}"
  cluster_name                      = "Test AWS Cluster TerraForm"
  provider_code                     = "aws"
  provider_keyset                   = "${data.stackpoint_keysets.keyset_default.aws_keyset}"
  region                            = "us-east-2"
  k8s_version                       = "v1.8.3"
  startup_master_size               = "${data.stackpoint_instance_specs.master-specs.node_size}"
  startup_worker_count              = 2
  startup_worker_size               = "${data.stackpoint_instance_specs.worker-specs.node_size}"
  zone                              = "us-east-2a"
